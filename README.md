Shared Design Files for Building a "Cat Condo"
Original Design Based on work by Chris Peterson Hexagon Caverns https://corokitty.wordpress.com/2014/03/30/hexagon-caverns/
Simplified for quick production and ease of build for kids and adults @757Makerspace courtesy of design input and building with @lynloo & @beauturner

You Will Need:
Razor Blade, 
Tape Measure, 
Duct Tape, 
1/2" or thicker wood (suitable for use outside), 
Coraplast (for two pieces, 18"x48" and 18"x42")

Wooden Rings:
For the wooden rings and infill, use minimum 1/2" wood to hold the shape.
If you have access to a CNC machine, the design files have a layer called "ToolpathLines". If you cut the outside for this and use the center toolpah and a 1/4" bit, it will cut your inside and outside at the same time (and the entry hole) easily. For this design we used a ShopBot Desktop and the entry center infill , exterior ring took under 1.5 minutes and the rear center infill and exterior ring was less than 30 seconds. 

Coraplast:
Coraplast is corrugated plastic, its thin plastic than has channels. We see these typically use in exterior signs for businesses and political advertisements. Some cities may collect these and be a source where you can get these for free (or leftover from candidates). 

For the coraplast, we have found that using pieces 18" wide is an ideal size for the front to back length of the Cat Condos. You will need to cut half-way through the coraplast to aid in bending the coraplast to fit the wood shape (inside and out).

Inside Coraplast:
The inside layer should have a piece of coraplast that is 18"x42" and will require 6 equal pieces at 6-7/16" cut half-way through. Tip: we have a little overage for the last piece (after your last cut) on purpose, this is used to wedge the plastic to the wood.

Outside Coraplast:
The outside layer should have a pice of coraplast that is 18"x48" and will require 6 equal pieces at 8", cut half-way through.

Assembly:
Start with the outer wood ring and your inside coraplast piece. Put the ring around the coraplast, then fit your inside wood panel until it aligns with the outside wood ring (typcially about 1.5" back from the ends. Now repeat for the other end.

Next wrap the 8" outside coraplast layer around the structure and with two small pieces of duct tape, fasten them together. Now you can put a strip along the whole edge where the start/end of the coraplast come together. Using a hot glue gun, secure just the corners of each heaxagon point for the inside and outside ring. Repeat on the other end. Now insert some hay and your cat condo is ready for deployment outside.
